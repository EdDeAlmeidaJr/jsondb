# JSONDB

## JSONDB is a highly sophisticated DBMS based on JSON files.

- It may use REST or SQL calls.
- A great option for testing purposes, if your software if configurable enough to accept an easy database change.

By the way, if your software can't easily change from one DBSM to another, then **your software is the real problem**!
